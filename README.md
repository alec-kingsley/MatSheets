# MatSheets

Sheets app in MATLAB using `simpleGameEngine.m`.

## Usage

The SimpleGameEngine restricts input to be exclusively via mouse or keyboard at a time, which imposes some restrictions upon this app.

Any cell can be edited by clicking the cell and typing in a new value. Hitting the `esc` key will cancel this operation, and `return` will save the updated value.

The `Copy` and `Paste` buttons must be clicked before clicking a desired cell to either copy it or paste to it from the system clipboard.

`Save As` and `Load` each work with `.csv` files. `New` will erase all progress.
